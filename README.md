
# Josh's Opera GX Keyboard Sounds (But Worse™)

This is a **completely useless** Python app that plays sounds from **Let's Game It Out... but cursed** mod in Opera GX based on what key you press.

Except it's even better (or worse?) – because Josh actually **announces** the correct key you press out loud (not like the actual mod, picking it randomly), using ~stolen~ extracted `.mp3` files. 🎧

> ❗ Warning: you can't close the app. There's no UI. No tray icon. No exit button.  
> To stop it: **RESTART YOUR ENTIRE PC**. 🤭
