
# Josh's Opera GX Keyboard Sounds (But Worse™)

This is a **completely useless** Python app that plays **Opera GX keyboard sounds** based on what key you press.

Except it's even better (or worse?) – because Josh **announces** the key you press out loud, using lovingly ~stolen~ extracted `.mp3` files. 🎧

> ❗ Warning: you can't close the app. There's no UI. No tray icon. No exit button.  
> To stop it: **RESTART YOUR ENTIRE PC**. 🤭
